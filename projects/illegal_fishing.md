# Illegal Fishing Detection

## Problem Statement
Illegal, unreported, and unregulated (IUU) fishing depletes fish stocks, damages marine ecosystems, and threatens the livelihoods of coastal communities. Detecting vessels operating in restricted or “dark zones” is difficult due to the vastness of oceans and limited monitoring resources. This project challenges participants to develop methods to identify suspicious vessels and patterns in real-time.

## Background
IUU fishing accounts for 20–30% of global catches and contributes to overfishing and habitat destruction. Satellite AIS data, radar, and ocean imagery can help track vessel locations, but large-scale detection remains a challenge.

## Datasets
- [Global Fishing Watch AIS Data](https://globalfishingwatch.org/data/) – vessel positions and movements.  
- [Sentinel-1/2 Satellite Imagery](https://sentinels.copernicus.eu/web/sentinel/home) – detect vessels visually.  
- [Ocean and Weather Data](https://www.noaa.gov/) – for contextual analysis of vessel movement patterns.

## Suggested Approaches
- Machine learning to detect suspicious movement patterns.  
- Satellite image analysis to identify vessels in restricted zones.  
- Geospatial dashboards for visualizing hotspots of illegal activity.  
- Anomaly detection combining AIS and satellite imagery.

## Difficulty
Hard

## Potential Impact
By identifying illegal fishing activities more quickly and accurately, authorities and NGOs can enforce regulations, protect marine biodiversity, and preserve sustainable fisheries.

## Submission / Deliverables
- Visualization dashboard of suspicious vessel activity.  
- Detection algorithms (ML/AI or rule-based).  
- Documentation with data sources, methods, and suggested deployment strategies.
