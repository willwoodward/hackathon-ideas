# Marine Debris Tracking

## Problem Statement
Millions of tonnes of plastic and waste float across oceans, threatening marine life, fisheries, and coastal communities. While cleanup initiatives exist, they are inefficient without precise knowledge of where debris accumulates or how it moves. This project challenges participants to detect and track floating plastic patches to guide targeted cleanup and prevention efforts.

## Background
Plastic pollution kills wildlife, damages ecosystems, and affects human livelihoods. The Ocean Cleanup and NOAA track debris manually or via limited satellite data. Automated, data-driven monitoring can drastically improve the effectiveness of cleanup operations and resource allocation.

## Datasets
- [Sentinel-2 Satellite Imagery](https://sentinels.copernicus.eu/web/sentinel/home) – multispectral images of the oceans.  
- [Ocean Cleanup datasets](https://theoceancleanup.com/) – historical marine debris tracking data.  
- [NOAA Ocean Data](https://www.noaa.gov/) – ocean currents, temperature, and wind data for drift prediction.

## Suggested Approaches
- Image segmentation to detect plastic patches in satellite images.  
- Geospatial visualizations showing accumulation zones and movement over time.  
- Predictive modeling of debris drift using ocean currents and wind patterns.  
- Dashboards for visualizing trends and suggesting cleanup routes.

## Difficulty
Medium

## Potential Impact
This project could help organizations like The Ocean Cleanup target areas more effectively, optimize cleanup operations, and quantify long-term pollution trends — reducing ecological damage and improving resource efficiency.

## Submission / Deliverables
- Interactive map or dashboard showing debris hotspots.  
- Codebase for detection/prediction algorithms.  
- Documentation explaining data sources, methods, and potential real-world deployment.
