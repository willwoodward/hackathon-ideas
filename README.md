A curated list of real-world problems with hackathon project ideas. Each project includes:  
- Problem statement  
- Datasets to use  
- Suggested approaches / technologies  
- Difficulty level  

Often when doing a hackathon, it is difficult to come up with ideas. Through focussing on problems aligned with the UN Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), we provide some problems and ideas that could feasibly be implemented in a hackathon, with the potential to solve real-world problems.
